Maciej Cegłowski has an excellent [article](http://idlewords.com/2010/03/scott_and_scurvy.htm) over at [Idle Words](http://idlewords.com/) about the discovery, abandonment and rediscovery of the cure for scurvy. It’s a wonderfully written exposition on how backwards “scientific” thinking can be sometimes. It also happens to contain some interesting stories of late 19th/early 20th century polar exploration, a topic I was deeply interested in around 2002.
